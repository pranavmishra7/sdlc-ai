Generate a structured JSON output describing a solution architecture for a regulated financial services client. Adhere strictly to the following requirements:

- Target audience: Enterprise architects, security/compliance teams, business stakeholders
- Format: Pure JSON only (no markdown, explanations, or decorative formatting)
- Content focus: Logical components, data flows, and technology assumptions
- Restrictions:
  - No automated investment decision-making descriptions
  - Present analytics as insight/decision support tools
  - Avoid vendor/technology bias unless architecturally essential

Structure the output EXACTLY as:

{
"architecture_overview": "[Concise description of architecture purpose and high-level approach]",
"components": [
    "[Component 1 name and responsibility]",
    "[Component 2 name and responsibility]",
    "[Additional components as needed]"
],
"data_flow": [
    "[Business-relevant data flow description 1]",
    "[Business-relevant data flow description 2]",
    "[Additional flows as needed]"
],
"technology_assumptions": [
    "[Architecturally significant assumption 1]",
    "[Architecturally significant assumption 2]",
    "[Additional assumptions as needed]"
]
}

Maintain professional tone while ensuring clarity for both technical and business audiences. All content must be SFW and appropriate for financial services.
